Fife,"For those nearing the end of their budget, but who still want to experience the best of Croatian cuisine, Buffet Fife is the place to go. Located in the upcoming Veli Varos neighborhood, historically known for its fishermen, this Split institution offers a true local experience of indifferent service, loud kitchen staff, crowded table sharing and, of course, cheap wine. There are daily specials on offer here, anything ranging from chicken hot pot or black cuttlefish risotto to fried sardines and lamb meatballs with boiled potatoes. Whatever you choose, everything is delicious and sourced from the freshest ingredients.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fife/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355df89baf6b07:0x5041498ffd19d3f5,,
Konoba Matejuska,"Konoba Matejuska can be found occupying the ground of an old Dalmatian house that was built in the 19th century. Exuding a rustic ambience, the cozy, family-run restaurant specializes in top-notch seafood at no-fuss prices by the weight. Come early or reserve as there are only five or six tables squeezed into the below street-level dining room. The black risotto is a speciality here so consider your options carefully when confronted by the delicious menu of local dishes and refreshing wines.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Konoba+Matejuska/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dff2d034f63:0x4d29c1345367dc6d,,
Zinfandel Food & Wine bar,"!!! Food & Wine Bar Zinfandel is located in the old part of Split. The place is modern and chic. The design is contemporary with brick walls and big floor-to-ceiling windows that can open completely.

Zinfandel has over 100 international and Croatian wines on offer, as well as a wide choice of seasonal tapas and cold platters. Look for their lunchtime specials when you get a free glass of house wine with food, or sometimes they just put all the items on the menu at half price.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zinfandel+Food+%26+Wine+bar/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dfe484b299b:0x4464bd81a1e921e7,,

Kantun Paulina,"Kantun Paulina – or Paulina’s Corner – is another of the classic Split places to eat. For almost 50 years the unassuming corner restaurant has been serving up some of the best food in Split, Croatia. Popular with locals and visitors, guests line up for Kantun Paulina’s famous cevapi. Although considered the national dish of neighboring Bosnia Herzegovina, cevapi are popular throughout the Balkans.

The little grilled sausages – made from a mixture of beef and pork – are stuffed into pillowy somun bread along with raw onions and then slathered with a pepper sauce, called ajvar. To take this cevapi sandwich over the top, we always order it with kajmak, a clotted cream.

Cevapi are considered one of the top cheap eats in Split, Croatia and Kantun Paulina is the place to get them! A massive sandwich with seven sausages and added kajmak costs 39 kuna (about $5.50).",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kantun+Paulina/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dfe99fe7705:0xf38baeb72bf39c7c,,
ST Burek,"Split Burek, which uses the abbreviation ST Burek, is one of the best places in Split for a quick and satisfying meal. It’s also one of the cheap places to eat in Split, with a hearty portion of burek costs just 16 kuna, which is about $2.25 USD.

A Balkan classic, burek is phyllo dough stuffed with spiced minced meat that is baked and served like a pie. Available at many bakeries and shops in Split and the region, the burek at ST Burek is perfection.

Variations at ST Burek include fillings of cheese, apple or spinach – but, trust us, the meat burek, called mesom, is by far the best. We often eat at ST Burek for lunch, but it’s also consumed as a favorite late-night snack or morning hangover remedy.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/ST+Burek/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dfe64deed93:0xbb75fc6aa29c0a5b,,
Pizzeria Galija,"Pizzeria Galija is one of the Split Old Town restaurants that we return to time and time again – and it’s because their pizzas are simply delicious. A Split institution, the restaurant opened in 1980 and has been creating incredible wood-fired pizzas ever since. The Pizzeria Galija Split menu includes a range of classic and regional pizzas, as well as a handful of other Italian dishes.

Although there are many pizzas (and we’ve tried our fair share!), the Seljacka pizza ranks as my favorite. The first time I ordered it, I was leery of the unique toppings, which included beans. However, odd as it might sound, in my opinion, it is the best pizza in Split!",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pizzeria+Galija/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dfe974e7271:0x2b02587745706111,,
Villa Spiza,"Tucked down the narrow and popular Petra Kuzica Street, Villa Spiza Split is actually two spaces across the lane from one another. However, getting a table still requires excellent timing, as they proudly don’t take reservations and tables are always in high demand.

The hand-written menu adjusts daily and of course always features loads of seafood and meat dishes. On our most recent visit, I went with the grilled lamb (tender and tasty) and Kris had the truffle pasta (melt in your mouth incredible). The staff are enthusiastic and helpful, and most importantly, the food is simply amazing!",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Villa+Spiza/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dfe123392f1:0xf30c6024ce7bef1b,,
Uje Oil Bar,"!!! Uje Oil Bar is a tapas-style restaurant, located at the heart of Split old town. The place has a very good vibe, friendly staff, tasty food, excellent choice of olive oils and wines. The food is served on wooden boards and in tinware. The warm dishes menu is updated daily, while cold cuts, marinated fish, and a choice of olive oils are available daily. The prices are reasonable.

We recommend starting with the burrata in baked pepper – and don’t miss the Olive Oil Experience (where the waiter explains the product). For mains, any dish will satisfy, but my personal favorite is the Pasta from Skradin.

The outdoor tables along the lane are the most atmospheric, but guests can also opt to eat indoors or just down the lane at the Uje Wine Bar.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Uje+Oil+Bar/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dfe17e30e8d:0xf3434c8541d95add,,
Konoba Kod Joze,"!!! A classic Croatian restaurant in Split, Konoba Kod Joze is located just out of the hustle and bustle of the Old Town – yet, it can be easily reached on foot. The restaurant’s stone interior is a dimly-lit and cozy space, but there are also tables on an outdoor, covered patio. Featuring traditional Dalmatian dishes, diners have a choice of seafood, pastas and meat dishes.

One of our favorite things to eat at Kod Joze is peka. The authentic dish is slow-cooked in a covered pot over the embers of an open fire. The dish is comprised of either octopus or meat and in-season vegetables. Peka is a meal that is typically shared by at least four people (so if you are a couple, find another couple to share in the experience!).

Top Tip: Peka often must be ordered a day in advance.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Konoba+Kod+Joze/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355f8c237c0869:0x3f46f49dd4ae78a9,,
Konoba Fetivi,"!!! Konoba Fetivi, located close to the harbor, is a small, family-run restaurant with a great atmosphere and excellent food. The restaurant can accommodate approximately 30 people, half inside, and a half at their outdoor terrace. Reservations are needed, especially during the summer.

Tavern offers traditional regional dishes mostly based on seafood, but they have meat dishes as well. Offer changes with the season. Food is prepared in a simple way. Everything served here is very fresh and tasty. The service is friendly. This konoba is more expensive than the others listed here. It is one of the highly recommended Split restaurants.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Konoba+Fetivi/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355df8d41c3e97:0x4ef1259ee55c2c49,,
Sandwich Bar Rizzo,"Rizzo has been serving sandwiches in Split since 1992, and today it has four locations in Split. They have a great homemade bread (the secret of a good sandwich is in good bread), and a variety of subway-style sandwiches, as well as bruschettas. Sandwiches come in two sizes: big, and small. Prices vary from 12 to 20 Kn depending on stuffing. You can also choose extra ingredients for an additional 2 Kn per ingredient.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sandwich+Bar+Rizzo/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355e0870081fc3:0x9dfafdedc13d719b,,
Oš Kolač,"Os kolac, in our opinion, isnt only the best cake shop in Split, but in all of Croatia. If you like sweets, you absolutely must visit this place.

The owner and the head pastry chef, Tea Mamut, not only studied pastry at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America, but she also worked in two famed New Your City restaurants - Jean Georges and Daniel, and learned the skill alongside the best international pastry chefs, like Dominique Ansel, Johnny Iuzzini, and Rene Frank,

All this experience as well as her passion for pastry shows in the cakes she makes. They are simply another level and some of the best we ever had.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/O%C5%A1+Kola%C4%8D/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dfdc7b363f3:0x3fb03b5ce5e387af,,
Movi,"We like this unpretentious restaurant located in Firule neighborhood, just across the tennis courts. The food is excellent and super fresh. Besides the items on the menu, there are always a couple of daily dishes written on a chalkboard. We always go with the daily dish and have never had a bad meal here.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Movi/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x133560a70d0d3803:0x7acb8a410459e3ab,,
Konoba Hvaranin,"Tavern Kod Hvaranina is a shabby-looking restaurant, just out of the Palace walls. The restaurant has a really weary look, but the food is very good. Besides, I like places with such an interior as they make me feel nostalgic, reminding me of some other times.

It is a small, family-run restaurant, and you feel it. The food is homely, fresh, and tasty. They serve a very good traditional baby beef stew with gnocchi (Cro. pasticada). Seafood served here comes from local fishermen. Service can vary from great to poor. The prices are reasonable.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Konoba+Hvaranin/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13355dfecee3ee0f:0x2dccacf0d190c6,,
