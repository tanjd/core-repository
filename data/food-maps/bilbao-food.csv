Lola taberna,"Take the suspended cable car across from Portugalete to the more upscale Getxo. After an energetic hike around the promenade, you'll be ready to eat once more. We hiked all the way to the small fishing village near Algorta which seems to spill down the hill into the sea. We stopped for fried calamari and patatas bravas at Bar Arantzale before taking the metro back to Bilbao. The calamari is extremely popular here so go early to avoid disappointment.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lola+taberna/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e5a3a1bd41581:0xb19c70ea961b5164,,
Txo,"While pintxos are cheap, my next picks for where to eat in Bilbao are further up the cost spectrum because you'll need to pay for a metro ticket to get there. Take public transportation to the port town of Portugalete. Seek out Txo which serves up pintxos in adorable casserole dishes. My selected pintxo was comprised of potatoes, bechamel, bacon and more cheese and was definitely a candidate for the best pintxos in Bilbao in my opinion.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Txo/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e5987790bb315:0x5713eee9e81ece0c,,
Café Iruña,!!! Plump for the Moorish kebabs  – delicately spiced and nicely fatty they literally melt in your mouth,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caf%C3%A9+Iru%C3%B1a/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e4fd01beb7c09:0x630ebb60f76c89b8,,
Rio-Oja Restaurant,"Pintxos are replaced by homemade stews on the bar at Rio-Oja, an unassuming restaurant in the centre of Bilbao’s Siete Calles (as the Casco Viejo is also known). To remind yourself that Basque cuisine is not all about ingeniously topped bread, order a helping of the lamb, beef, rabbit or fish stews, which are ladled out of bowls in the heated display and served with chunks of rustic bread. If you prefer a lighter bite, opt for clams in green sauce or paella.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rio-Oja+Restaurant/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e4fcc2a06552d:0x40911c6234b1f029,,
El Globo taberna,"Early arrival is essential at El Globo, a popular eatery offering an enormous range of pintxos, even by Bilbao’s standards. In case you’re overwhelmed by the choice presented in the bar’s glass displays, opt for one or all three of the house specialties: pintxos topped with spider crab gratin, morcilla and peanuts or baby squid and squid ink. Also available are a take-away service and main dishes that feature veggie options, soups, stews and salads.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/El+Globo+taberna/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e4fd0b3640f79:0x9b7af0da2a260c87,,
Café Bar Bilbao,"Opened in 1911, this blue-fronted joint is one of the best pintxos spots in the Casco Viejo. Take a seat at the marble-and-brass bar or out on the Plaza Nueva terrace and snack on bread topped with cured hams, tortilla, roasted peppers and various types of cheese. Alternatively, try one of the rarely seen choices, such as duck or crispy elvers. Main courses and breakfasts are also served, and there’s a good selection of red and white wines from the Basque Country.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caf%C3%A9+Bar+Bilbao/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e4fda6e67737b:0x39706b61a0fc7059,,

Los Fueros,"Prawns from Huelva, battered hake with roasted pepper mayonnaise and slow-cooked pork ribs headline at Los Fueros, a Michelin-recommended restaurant in the Old Town, known as the Casco Viejo. There are four spaces in which to enjoy the contemporary cuisine: a pristine ground-floor space with tile mosaics on the walls, a mezzanine with two tables for special occasions, a first-floor dining room with kitchen views and an outside terrace. Start things off with their suggested amuse bouche – a prawn-infused bloody Mary.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Los+Fueros/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e4fceb6269d65:0xf075b1433f1569ac,,
La Viña del Ensanche,"!!! there’s a reason that La Viña del Ensanche is renowned for their Jamon Iberico – it really is that good. 

Try and make a reservation, even if you don’t, the friendly staff will do their very best to try and squeeze you in at a spot by the bar at the very least.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Vi%C3%B1a+del+Ensanche/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e4fd7353e5cd3:0x62ad623d2912af42,,
Artxanda jatetxea,"It’s unlikely that you see any other tourists, this is a fair and square neighbourhood haunt serving freshly prepared dishes and ridiculously good value wine (as in €1.40 a glass good value). 

Take a seat at the bar if you are only having a quick bite to eat or settle into one of the larger tables for a more formal meal. Either way get ready for some tasty eats.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Artxanda+jatetxea/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd4e4fc35a041583:0x3dc6cd62db3513b0,,
