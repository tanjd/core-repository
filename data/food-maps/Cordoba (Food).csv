"""""""""""""""Salinas,""""""""!!! A classic in Cordoba, and the best place for traditional dishes in my opinion. It’s been open about 100 years, and you can sit in the bar or the restaurant. We hit the bar, and ordered three local classics - rabo de toro (bull tail stew), salmorejo (cold tomato soup - thicker than gazpacho) and berenjenas fritas (floured and fried eggplant slices). All were fantastic."""""""",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Salinas/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd6cdf7db5e8f3e1:0xdb8c3549bc29b487,,"""""""",""""""""Local food/drink item"""""""","""""""""""""""",""""""""food,local"""""""","""""""""""""""""""""",""""""Local food/drink item"""""","""""""""""",""""""food,local"""""",""""""""""""","Local food/drink item","","food,local",""
"""""""""""""""Taberna Góngora,""""""""!!! Another classic joint in Cordoba.
