Restoran Thean Chun,"chee cheong fun to the famous kai see hor fun, pork satay, wantan mee and caramel egg custard pudding. Everything was delicious.

One of the must-try here is their Kai See Hor Fun, which means Chicken Kway Teow Soup. 

This satay stall operates from the side alley between Kong Heng & Thean Chun. They are probably one of the rare stalls in Ipoh that sells pork satay. The pork skewers are grilled with charcoal flames, with minimal burnt bits and a small proportion of fats. The satay is so succulent and served with spicy-sweet peanut sauce. If you still have some tummy space, go for their chee cheong fun, popiah and caramel custard. So much good food here!",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Restoran+Thean+Chun/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x31caec7c6776b3f7:0x4f3cbab979072632,,
