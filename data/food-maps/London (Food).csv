Patty & Bun,"The Best Cheap Burgers in London
The Best Cheap Burgers in London - Lucky chip
Pull up a stool!
By Stephanie Theocharous

I have started an affair with burgers. It’s going so well I need to share it on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. I couldn’t stop posting pictures of burgers from all over London. The food fashion has started. Searching for the best burger in the capital was my mission and I didn’t surrender until I found it.

Here are the 5 best cheap burgers in London that you definitely have to visit!

Falling in love with the juiciest, greasiest burgers in London, began one year ago when I first tasted a MEATLiquor burger, it was legendary.

#1 MEATLIQUOR | W1, LONDON, BACON CHEESEBURGER, £8
Rating 10/10

For £8 you can have a bacon cheeseburger (as seen in the picture) and believe me you wont be disappointed. It’s madly juicy – good fat content and with paper towels right there on the table get ready to get messy. As for the bun, it’s just the right amount for this grease beef explosion! But don’t stop there we are not done yet. The experience is not completed without mouth-watering chilly fries and pickles with blue cheese sauce. Check MeatLiquor’s Facebook page.

#2 LUCKY CHIP | E8, NW5,  LONDON, BACON CHEESEBURGER, £8,50
Rating 10/10

This magnificent burger can be found in a burger van in East London (and now The Seabright Arms). The Lucky Chip‘s 32-day-aged, rough-hewn Wiltshire beef baby is salty, big and bouncy, topped with mustard and ketchup. Of course, the burger isn’t lacking the delicious toppings of American cheese and smoked bacon. Have fun with some of their other burgers as well, the Selleck, the Sheen, the Danny Trejo, and the Chuck Norris.

#3 PATTY AND BUN | W1, LONDON, ARI GOLD BURGER, £7,50
Rating 9/10

Serving a grass fed Angus steak perfectly pink, Patty and Bun’s burgers will put a smile on your face every time. The burger includes the super brioche; inside the perfectly cooked beef topped smoky P&B mayo and cheese. Don’t forget, to take with you a portion of the special fries with rosemary salt they are to die for!",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Patty+%26+Bun/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48760343eff66979:0x21479fefbe9261af,,
The Culpeper,"The Culpeper is an East end boozer with a difference. Spanning four floors, the venue has a first-floor restaurant, hotel rooms and even a rooftop garden with a veg patch. The Culpeper’s roast menu has four options to choose from, including Bavette and a veggie wellington, which all come with a massive Yorkshire pudding, top-tier roasties, honey glazed carrots, parsnips, greens and a generous portion of gravy. Our top tip, save room for their sticky toffee pudding with creme fraiche, and wash it down with one of their Martinez.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Culpeper/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x41703156e2f3fa01:0x3234647c9723c808,,
Mercato Mayfair,"Hit the two-story Mercato Mayfair—which, housed in a restored church, may be the most beautiful food hall I’ve ever seen. After a quick drink at Cha Cha Mayfair upstairs (it’s never too early for an Aperol Spritz), we tried Steamy & Co. for bao buns and Molo for seafood. If you’re in for an evening visit, don’t miss the basement Cheese and Charcuterie Vault and the Wine Bar for a treat and glass in rustic, intimate quarters.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mercato+Mayfair/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48760509d1f4d6b7:0xeb4ea82d4f8172d1,,
