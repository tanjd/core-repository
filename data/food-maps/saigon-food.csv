Bánh Mì Hòa Mã,"A beautiful alternative to the banh mi sandwich is a Vietnamese dish called op la, or eggs cooked in a littler personal pan, often supplemented by slices of meat like ham, onions, and served with those wonderful crusty Vietnamese baguettes.

Just like some other dishes on this blog, op la offers a bit of a fusion of Vietnamese and Western ingredients and cooking methods, all blended into a single meal.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/B%C3%A1nh+M%C3%AC+H%C3%B2a+M%C3%A3/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x31752f218f22cc1d:0x5989fc3cc9f4d5b7,,
