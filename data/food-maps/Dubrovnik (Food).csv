Konoba King,"If you want to venture out of the city, Matičević suggests Konoba KING, located in Plat, a seaside village about a 20-minute drive away. “It is a family-run restaurant serving simple dishes with local and fresh ingredients,” she says. “It is truly an off-the-beaten-path place, but more and more people are hearing about it, which has made it very popular and busy these days.” Once you arrive, you’ll see the cosiness of the restaurant, as well as its inviting terrace and open fireplace – where the owner, who is also a chef, will prepare fresh grilled fish, steak or shrimp for you. “Local people like it for its simplicity, huge portions and fair prices,” Matičević says.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Konoba+King/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x134c0d902c8f4c15:0x1c18ce819cc4f9c,,
Konoba Dubrovnik,"Restaurant Konoba Dubrovnik is located in the village of Lozica, about a 15-minute car ride from Dubrovnik, and is open from June to October. “For us, this is a hidden gem,” Matičević says. “Although they only have a few dishes on the menu, the thing that draws you is the family atmosphere.” Pricing-wise, she believes it’s “very reasonable, and much cheaper than many restaurants in the city.” Aside from getting value for money, Matičević notes that the best things about the restaurant include: the fresh meat and ingredients, the big portions of food and the owners who act as though you’re guests at their home. “If you can’t decide what to eat, have the veal liver. Or, if you’re very hungry, try the beefsteak with fried onions on top,” she suggests.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Konoba+Dubrovnik/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x134c7592ea0e3111:0x2552f67f573b4867,,
Proto Fish Restaurant,"If you’re in the market for some fine dining, Proto Fish Restaurant makes for an ideal place to go. “It has a lovely roof terrace on the main street in Old Town and has a long tradition of offering the best quality catch-of-the-day fish,” Matičević says. “Fish soup and the sea bass baked in salt are something you should try.” In addition to top-notch service, she says you’ll also find wine expert Siniša Lasan, who was crowned “Best Croatian Sommelier” in 2019 by the National Sommelier Championship. “These are some of the things – beside food – that make this restaurant so special,” Matičević says.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Proto+Fish+Restaurant/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x134c0b328c1e3333:0x9b046c38c38d1f76,,
MOSKAR Street Food,"If you want to sample some local food, Matičević recommends Moskar on the restaurant-laden Prijeko Street. Although it is small, with only a dozen seats inside and a handful outside, that’s what she says makes it so charming. “I like it because of the cosy atmosphere and the menu, which is not too big but includes all the local food that foodies need to try when they come to Dubrovnik,” Matičević says. “I recommend trying pašticada – slowly cooked stewed beef flavoured with smoked bacon, cinnamon, bay leaves and cloves – and mussels prepared buzara style – in a sauce made of tomatoes and white wine.”",https://www.google.com/maps/place/MOSKAR+Street+Food/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x134c0b32e8e07647:0xb53e6ee934778907,,
Taj Mahal Old Town,"Although this restaurant, Taj Mahal, has an Indian name, it’s actually a Bosnian restaurant, Matičević points out. “Local people like Bosnian specialties, which are – of course – influenced by the cuisine of the former Ottoman Empire,” she says. Along with meat specialities, there are also plenty of vegetarian options. If you’re looking for suggestions on what to order, Matičević has several recommendations, including fritters with kaymak (thick cream cheese), burek (roasted rolled meat pie), cheese and spinach pie, and čevapi (traditional grilled sausages of minced meat) in somun (flatbread) with kaymak and raw onion. Taj Mahal has two locations, one in the Old Town and one in Hotel Lero outside the city walls. “And last, but not less important, is the warm hospitality,” Matičević reflects. “They will also offer you their traditional after-dinner drink – quince liqueur – and you shouldn’t say no.”",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taj+Mahal+Old+Town/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x134c0b325dbf342b:0x5db4c478d1cd960f,,
Pantarul,"Pantarul, a few kilometres from Dubrovnik’s Old Town, is a family-owned restaurant that was opened by Ana-Marija Bujić, a food blogger and the author of two cookbooks – which are also for sale on the premises. The food is based on local ingredients with a farm-to-table concept, so the menu changes seasonally.
