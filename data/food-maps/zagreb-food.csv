Vincek slastičarnica,"An ice cream institution since it opened in 1977, Vincek is serving the other best ice cream in Zagreb. Service is surly and lines are long, but the top quality ice cream negates any minor inconveniences.

We licked several Vincek cones during our time in Zagreb, alternating between fruity flavors like schwarzwald (black forest) and more traditional flavors like dark chocolate and cheesecake. Vincek also serves cakes and pastries, but we can’t comment on their quality since we never got past the ice cream. It was that good.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vincek+slasti%C4%8Darnica/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6fd3d2b7285:0x7581a851f1c16bc4,,
Meet Mia,"Like moths to the flame, we were drawn into Meet Mia. Once we saw the glass pastry case, we jumped right into the fire. For that, we have no regrets and only happy memories.

Mia Salman opened the tony cake bar decorated in a chic, art deco style. She bakes each tiny dessert with fine ingredients like Belgian chocolate and fresh fruit. Since prices are reasonable at Meet Mia, why not order two desserts and add a macaron or two.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Meet+Mia/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d7002bf3de6b:0xb6953cf0242e83ff,,
Amélie,"dessert With three locations in Zagreb, Amélie can take some credit for making Zagreb a sweeter place to visit. Cute and cozy, Amélie offers a full range of desserts baked with ingredients sourced from Austria, Belgium and France.

When you visit Amelie, the hard part won’t be deciding whether to take a break from your busy day. Instead, it will be narrowing down the choices of tempting treats.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Am%C3%A9lie/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6fe06fa8183:0x8a969aaa4866007c,,

Dolac,"A statue of Kumica Barica (which literally means Godmother Barica – a tribute to the peasant women who graced the market in days gone by) greets shoppers at Dolac Market, Zagreb’s biggest and busiest market.

These shoppers come to buy ultra-fresh products from farmers who travel from nearby villages to peddle their wares. They also come to buy fresh fish, dairy and meat. A central hub since 1926, this market separates the more modern, urbane Upper Town from the medieval, cobblestoned Lower Town.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dolac/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6fdf4a4be33:0x4e3ec5eac5ce2a40,,
Pingvin,"Pingvin has been a local Zagreb favorite since it started serving reasonably priced sandwiches to the hungry masses in 1987. In many ways, the shop reminded us of cheesesteak shops in Philadelphia for the dining experience alone.

Grilled to order, Pingvin’s sandwiches are chock full of proteins like beef, chicken and fish, though vegetarians will find options as well. Although the name Pingvin translates to Penguin, the arctic bird is not a sandwich option. Optional toppings include corn, tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, mayonnaise and hot peppers.

Since Pingvin quickly became our late night and mid-afternoon go-to spot, we ate quite a few of their sandwiches and sides. After much research, we honed our favorites to the grilled beef ficlecki sandwich and fries. Two of these sandwiches and an order of fries to share would set us back 86 kuna (approximately $10 USD), not a bad price for two people to eat so well.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pingvin/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6fc38aaa5fd:0x2b95a9c74ec97ef4,,
Stari Fijaker,"f you want to enjoy traditional food and beer in a historic restaurant in the heart of Zagreb, then Stari Fijaker is for you. Open since 1848 but operating in its current iteration since 1994, this local stalwart offers a full menu of Croatian classics at reasonable prices.

Plus, with a vibe that feels more like a beer hall than a restaurant, you won’t have to think twice about ordering a liter of beer to go with your meal. Živjeli! (That’s cheers to you and us.)",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stari+Fijaker/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6e2c254d947:0x1c9cb3e35a4276fe,,
GOSTIONICA RESTORAN PURGER,"Predating both World War II and communism, Purger has a sense of history that you can’t find at the newer restaurants in central Zagreb. Fast forward to the 21st century and Purger continues to serve Zagreb food favorites to Zagreb locals and the occasional tourists.

The atmosphere is friendly and the decor traditional with the restaurant’s gingham tablecloths and a cozy patio space in the back. Purger is a good choice for trying hearty stews, good grilled seafood and traditional favorites.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/GOSTIONICA+RESTORAN+PURGER/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6ff2711ce05:0x8fa19bce73327f04,,
Vinodol,"Proving that traditional Croatian food can be prepared with an eye toward gastronomy, popular Vinodol serves high-quality Croatian food in the center of Zagreb. Far from intimate, Vinodol’s space is massive with a large dining hall and an enclosed terrace.

Don’t be deterred by the cavernous dining space – the food here is quite good. Instead, pick your spot and get ready for a culinary tour of Croatia.

Vinodol serves Croatian classics like homemade Kulen and Octopus Salad (both pictured above). The spicy Kulenn was a daily special, whereas the Octopus Salad is a fixture on Vinodol’s menu. We also tried two generous pasta portions dishes including Fuzi, a traditional Croatian pasta served with fresh black Istrian truffles",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vinodol/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6fc4654e5a3:0xa88aa4e9a72b18d,,
Pri zvoncu,"Dining with friends at Pri Zvoncu allowed us to try a large sampling of dishes like Mezo z Tiblice, a traditional preparation of storing salted pork with lard in wooden vessels or tiblicas. Originally a way for people in Medimurje to conserve pork during the cold winter months, Mezo z Tiblice is now a special dish available at select Croatian restaurants.

We indulged in other Croatian favorites during our meal like cottage cheese and Zabrabacki Odrezak, a popular dish affectionately referred to as ‘Zagreb steak.’ Oozing with melted cheese and stuffed with chunks of ham, the main component of a Zagreb steak is breaded veal (not steak). Don’t worry, we also ate an actual brontosaurus-sized steak at Pri Zvoncu.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pri+zvoncu/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d68b5c91e00d:0x5798b78978475cc3,,
Vranyczanyeva ul. 6,"Grička Vještica - Proving that simple food can be as exciting as cutting-edge gastronomy, Grička Vještica serves hearty Croatian food that rivals the quality of restaurants serving food for triple the price.

Don’t be fooled by the cozy atmosphere and surly service, this restaurant is the real deal with a one-man kitchen cooking each dish to order just meters from the dining room. Food options fill a menu that reads like a book with page after page filled with soups, salads and meat dishes.

Named after the Witch of Grich, Grička Vještica serves the closest food to what Croatian mothers make for their families at home. Don’t be fooled by the touristic location (just off the funicular in Zagreb’s old town). This is the kind of homey food we crave when we travel the world – cuisine where you can taste centuries of cooking tradition in every bite.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vranyczanyeva+ul.+6/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6e2aac19655:0x99971e9f894e9a8,,
RougeMarin,"Situated in a former electric lamp factory away from the center of town, RougeMarin is a bistro that serves hamburgers including a rotating weekly burger special that can be ordered with one or two patties. Beyond the burgers, RougeMarin has a diverse menu with chicken, beef, pork and vegetarian options.

We trekked to RougeMarin to try their burger as well as a rack of BBQ ribs served Kansas City style with lots of sauce. Though we enjoyed experiencing the restaurant and its large outdoor terrace, we preferred eating RougeMarin’s street food when they catered the city-wide dvorišta event.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/RougeMarin/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d639074cfc0b:0xd8e2eea6c2a044b2,,
Mali Bar,"Shareable dishes, served tapas-style, dominate Mali Bar’s menu, most with a Mediterranean point of view.

Lari & Penatibnb,"Lari & Penati is the type of neighborhood restaurant that we would dine at again and again if it was nearby. Helmed by owner / Chef Igor Tomljenovic, the restaurant has a convivial vibe and cool decor.

Most importantly, the restaurant serves a good mix of Mediterranean and shareable bar food with reasonably priced wine. For our first meal at Lari & Penati, we sat outside and sampled a solid selection of dishes like Bacala Spread, Burattina with Goat Salami, Marinated Sea Bass Salad and Aubergine Parmigiana.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lari+%26+Penatibnb/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d6f88a083e55:0xd51a0a6159ffb26,,
Restaurant Agava,"!!! A little hidden gem that requires guests to climb 39 stairs to enter, Agava is located in the heart of the city but off the beaten track, ensuring a real departure from an ordinary day. The restaurant, led by owner and chef Belizar Miloš, opened in 2005 and has received warm feedback ever since. The atmoshpere is casual with a vintage touch, and the dining experience and food is of the highest quality. The Mediterranean-inspired kitchen serves such delectable and creative dishes as beef consommé, lamb chops with pepper confitand cipollineglazed in aceto balsamico, or mouthwatering Croatian traditional tastes, such as the fužiwith black truffles, or the Hvarska pogača.

Stari Puntijar,"Located at the foot of the Medvednica hills, in the suburbs of Zagreb, Stari Puntijar is an historical restaurant, whose unique game meat cuisine is worth a visit. Though situated outside of the heart of the city, it is still easily accessible for anyone wishing to enjoy ancient tastes, some of which date back to the 17th century. Originally operated as a small tavern, Stari Puntijar has been a family-owned restaurant for over 170 years, and clearly marks its provenance in the country. The setting is inspired by history and hunting, perfectly matching the kitchen’s aspirations. The deer dishes and apple desserts are among the must-try dishes, but pick any of the samples and the old flavours and modern techniques will play tricks on the senses. When visiting, don’t miss the restaurant’s special library, displaying the family’s collection of antique culinary, herb, and cook books.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stari+Puntijar/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d75eec08694f:0xba293daffffba3a5,,
Ul. Ivana Tkalčića 70,"Ivica i Marica - Growing from a tiny pastry shop, Ivica i Marica (‘Hansel & Gretel’ in Croatian) today stands for a quality brand known for its health-conscious supplies. Continuing the successful pastry shop while creating an adjoining restaurant, Ivica i Marica is the city’s best-known health food venue. While the pastry shop entertains kids and adults with a fairytale-like milieu, with biscuit corners and a wide range of healthy tastes for sweet-toothed guests, the restaurant displays a more rustic and traditional style, with waiters wearing Croatian costumes. Both premises use only natural ingredients, such as brown sugar and wholegrain flour, and leave out anything artificial. The restaurant creates delectable dishes from the local market’s freshest ingredients, and makes homemade bread and pasta creations. The restaurant serves excellent soups, organic beef, veal, and other traditional Croatian dishes, while the fig licorice, kremsnita and baklava are to die for.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ul.+Ivana+Tkal%C4%8Di%C4%87a+70/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4765d7031a15a59d:0x717d204bbeeba0e,,
