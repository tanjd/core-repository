Restaurant Tinel,"Tinel is a restaurant that values the importance of family and a laid-back atmosphere. They want you to feel warm and relaxed as you sit there. The name of the restaurant mirrors that. In coastal parts of Croatia, the word tinel used to mean the “living room.” And even today, some use that name, although it is archaic.

If you’re eating at Tinel, you may find yourself outside, on a narrow street, with people passing you by. But that just plays into the “one big family” theme that Tinel has. Regarding the food itself, they offer a combination of traditional meat and fish dishes, as well as salads with a local spin to them. And if you’re not in the mood to try something new, you can also grab a pizza here.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Restaurant+Tinel/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4761fa6fab3129c5:0xe05cb4c67b043358,,
