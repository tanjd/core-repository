Kimpo Khao Tom Pla,"a rice soup and seafood restaurant for dinner. They do fish rice soup extremely well here, and normally they have a giant fish hanging about the street food cart - but today they just had some pompanos. The first bowl of rice soup I had was khao tom tuk yang (ข้าวต้มทุกอย่าง), rice soup with everything - including seafood and fish. We also ordered luak pla gao (ลวกปลาเก๋า), boiled brown marbled grouper served with sauce. That was so good that we had another bowl of luak pla kapong (ลวกปลากะพง), boiled barramundi fish.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kimpo+Khao+Tom+Pla/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x30e298bf1f855be3:0x2aeee2ae9722c16f,,

Soei,"!!!
Soei is kaem pla too tod (แก้มปลาทูทอด), which are mackerel cheeks that are deep fried with garlic and served like crispy fish head chips. Another dish I ordered this meal at Soei was gaeng ba pla (แกงป่าปลา), Thai jungle curry with fish. He makes one of the best versions in Bangkok - it’s spicy, pungently flavorful, and packed with herbs and spices. But the ultimate dish to eat at Soei is boo neem pad pongari (ปูนิ่มผัดผงกะหรี่), soft shell crab in a Thai yellow egg curry, it’s EPIC, there’s no other way to put it.",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Soei/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x30e29c03f3af1d03:0x8df869b2ba9a585e,,
